EditorConfig Eclipse
====================

[EditorConfig] plugin for the Eclipse IDE.


Installation
------------

Install from [Eclipse Marketplace][marketplace] or using Eclipse update site:

    https://editorconfig-eclipse.github.io/repository

Usage
-----

No additional configuration is required other than creating .editorconfig
files. The plugin applies the editorconfig settings for a file when opened in a 
supported editor (currently Text, Java, XML and Ant editors). 


How It Works
------------

Whenever an Eclipse editor is opened or gains focus, the .editorconfig settings
are obtained for that editor's file and applied globally to all supported
editor types. How the editorconfig is obtained for any file is described in the
[EditorConfig docs][EditorConfig]:

    When opening a file, EditorConfig plugins look for a file named
    .editorconfig in the directory of the opened file and in every parent
    directory. A search for .editorconfig files will stop if the root filepath
    is reached or an EditorConfig file with root=true is found.
